# Loremasters-Armoury
 Introducing a Vermintide 2 Cosmetic mod created by dalo_kraff, using Jaffawer's Warhammer lore-frienldy shield heraldry designs. Originally created for Loremaster's Armoury Project (link below), this mod brings a whole crate of new shield illusions for Kerillian and Kruber.
Using the mod options menu provided by VMF you can choose which of the new shields to use on the corresponding vanilla illusion . Your choice will then change the respective illusion's item description and name as well as update the model if the skin is currently equiped.
The mod is client side so you can join or host games with players that don't have the mod enabled. As a consequence the client controls which illusions they see of other players with the mod.
